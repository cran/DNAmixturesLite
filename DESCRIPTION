Description: Statistical methods for DNA mixture analysis. This package is a lite-version of the 'DNAmixtures' package to allow users without a 'HUGIN' software license to experiment with the statistical methodology. While the lite-version aims to provide the full functionality it is noticeably less efficient than the original 'DNAmixtures' package. For details on implementation and methodology see <https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org/>.
